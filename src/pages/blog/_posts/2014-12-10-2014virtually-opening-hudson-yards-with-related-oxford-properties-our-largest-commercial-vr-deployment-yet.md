Over the past 6 months, we worked on a version of our graphics engine, [Luma](http://www.floored.com/technology/) , to deliver a native virtual reality (VR) experience that would run a massive scene (1M square feet) entirely in real-time, all at 90 frames per second (FPS) in the newest [Oculus Rift technology](https://www.oculus.com/dk2/). This was one of the biggest technical challenges we have faced as a company, which required deep coordination across our graphics, application, art and account management teams. 

We're proud to say that the VR experience was featured prominently at the Javits Center, alongside the Hudson Yards exhibit by Related Companies & Oxford Properties.

Dozens of retailers had a chance to experience VR for the first time and most were stunned by the realism and level of immersion that the technology offered. 

We're looking forward to doing much more in this area in 2015! If you have interest in discussing commercial VR implementations with us, give our sales team a shout at [sales@floored.com](mailto:sales@floored.com)
