### Protofit helped Two Trees find Grovo the perfect space for their rapidly growing team. Read on for the experiences of both the leasing team and their tenant.

**Leasing: Elizabeth Bueno, Associate Director at Two Trees Management**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Protofit was instrumental in Two Trees Management's process of leasing space at 50 W. 23rd Street to Grovo, one of the fastest growing startups in NYC. Grovo's growth had them in a fast-paced search for space that would serve their company's immediate and future needs. Protofit allowed us to instantly create customized testfits for initial and subsequent meetings with Grovo's leadership, helping answer questions about fit throughout the process. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently working on a proposal with another tenant who is moving quickly because we were able to show them how they will fit in the space. Floored's latest addition of interactive 3D has made Protofit an even more powerful tool for providing potential tenants with a vision of their future space."</span>

**Tenant: Jeff Fernandez, Co-Founder & CEO at Grovo**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"As the CEO of a high growth technology company, I've found that selecting our next office space is always a stressful process. Two Trees' use of Protofit 3D helped make this experience much more enjoyable. We were able to understand in a matter of minutes how the space fit our needs as well as how we could grow within the space. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As our team and real estate needs grow, Protofit 3D will continue to be a valuable part of the process."</span>
