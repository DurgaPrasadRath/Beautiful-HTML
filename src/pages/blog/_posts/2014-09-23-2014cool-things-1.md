At Floored we read a lot of different stuff from all over the web. Each month we put together a list of the coolest stuff we've seen recently. Whether they're new, or just new to us, some will probably be new to you. Enjoy!

1.  Dynamic lighting becomes a puzzle in&nbsp;[this](http://www.shadowmatic.com/)&nbsp;forthcoming iPad app.

2.  A neat filtering&nbsp;[tool](http://david.li/filtering/).

3.  Created for a SIGGRAPH presentation,&nbsp;[this page](http://cabbi.bo/webby/)&nbsp;presents a&nbsp;<span>3d</span>&nbsp;story about a lonely "space puppy" in a psychedelic, underwater world, which is a thin allegory for the state of&nbsp;<span>3d</span>&nbsp;on the web.

4.  More amazing things are being done with&nbsp;[Oculus](https://share.oculusvr.com/app/ue4-rollercoaster).

5.  Nifty&nbsp;[<span>3d</span>&nbsp;gallery](http://olafureliasson.net/)&nbsp;for artist Olafur Eliasson, whose work is worthy of the "cool thing" title all by itself.

6.  Realtime face-tracking and&nbsp;[projection mapping](http://vimeo.com/103425574)

7.  A cool&nbsp;[clock animation](http://jackf.net/bezier-clock/)&nbsp;using bezier curves.

8.  Good&nbsp;[short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6T4M4VMuk&t=4m16s)&nbsp;from John Carmack on the new Samsung mobile VR display.

9.  Great&nbsp;<span>3d</span>&nbsp;[WebGL experience](http://riskeverything.nike.com/)&nbsp;from Nike.

10.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnuQzP3gty4&feature=youtu.be)&nbsp;monocular slam algorithm was really cool.
