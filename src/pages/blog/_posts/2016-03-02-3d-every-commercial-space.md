Video of Protofit 3D in Action

Over the last few years, Floored has built a set of new technologies for real estate visualization - providing universal access to interactive 3D digital spaces, which previously required the installation of special software and high end computing hardware.

Five months ago, Floored launched Protofit, with the intent of democratizing commercial office planning and visualization. Protofit takes what used to be a black-box process (performed using expensive tools that require years of training) and puts space planning directly in the hands of those who need it most: brokers, building owners, tenants and workplace managers.

This week we announce a unified platform that ties all of our technology together.

For the first time ever, using a basic form of input (2D CAD plan), Protofit will transform lines into a smart interactive 2D test-fit that can be easily reconfigured by lay users, finalized into a custom plan, and **generate a fully interactive 3D model with a single click.** A process that used to take days, if not weeks, is now compressed into a matter of seconds.

We're launching Protofit with 5 Default Style Templates that capture a broad variety of planning styles (Modern, Eclectic, Luxe, Conservative, and Industrial) that will allow you to view any space plan in a default style.

Custom Style

**We are also integrating Protofit with our extensive library of 10,000+ real-world-products** comprised of furniture, architectural materials, fixtures, artwork, accessories, which will allow fast customization of 3D "Style Packs." Specifying selections for custom style packs will allow Architects, Interior Designers, Furniture Sales Reps and Manufacturers, Space Planners, and Workplace Strategists, to create highly individualized 3D visualizations on-the-fly.
